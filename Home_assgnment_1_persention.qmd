## Introduction

-   **Topic:** Data Preparation and Initial Analysis
-   **Brief introduction**: Outline the objective of the analysis, which is to explore crime data in Chicago, understand patterns, and draw insights.
-   **Method**: Data manipulation and analysis using R

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Preparation and Initial Analysis

-   Imported 'Chicago_small.xlsx', focusing on crime data.

-   Initial display: First 10 rows & 5 columns, highlighting key crime types and locations.

-   Dataset originally had 200 rows and 11 columns.

-   Modifications included:

    -   Removal of 'Ward' and 'ID' columns.

    -   Renaming 'Domestic' column to 'Home'.

-   Data types identified using **`sapply`**.

-   EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) conducted to understand crime trends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Time-Based Analysis of Crime Data

-   Split 'Date' column into separate 'Date' and 'Time' columns.

-   Conversion to appropriate data types, omitting AM/PM in 'Time'.

-   Analysis focused on identifying most dangerous hours in Chicago.

-   Key finding: Specific hours showing higher crime rates (Need your input on specific hours if available).

-   Visual or table showing crime frequency by hour could be added (if data is available).Key Findings

### Text Analysis with Custom Function

-   Developed a custom function **`AverageVowels`** to analyze text data.

-   Purpose: Calculate the average number of vowels per input string.

-   Ensured input is a string and used a for loop for calculation.

-   Example outputs:

    -   **`AverageVowels("John")`** yields 0.25.

    -   **`AverageVowels("Jim")`** yields 0.33.

    -   **`AverageVowels("Eugene")`** yields 0.67.
